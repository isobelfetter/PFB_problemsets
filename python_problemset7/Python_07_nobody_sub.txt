Isobel by Shel Silverstein

Isobel loves me,
Isobel cares,
Isobel picks me peaches and pears.
Isobel offers me candy and Cokes,
Isobel listens and laughs at me jokes.
Isobel helps when I get in a fight,
Isobel does all my homework at night.
Isobel misses me,
Isobel cries,
Isobel thinks I'm a wonderful guy.
So if you ask me who's my best friend, in a whiz,
I'll stand up and tell you that Isobel is.
But yesterday night I got quite a scare,
I woke up and Isobel just wasn't there.
I called out and reached out for Isobel's hand,
In the darkness where Isobel usually stands.
Then I poked through the house, in each cranny and nook,
But I found somebody each place that I looked.
I searched till I'm tired, and now with the dawn,
There's no doubt about it-
Isobel's gone!
